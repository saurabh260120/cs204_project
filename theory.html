        <h3>FULL SUBTRACTOR CIRCUIT</h3><br>
        <P>A full subtractor is a combinational circuit that performs subtraction of two bits, one is minuend and other is subtrahend, taking into account borrow of the previous adjacent lower minuend bit. This circuit has three inputs and two outputs.</P><br>
        <p> The three inputs A, B and Bin, denote the minuend, subtrahend, and previous borrow, respectively. The two outputs, D and Bout represent the difference and output borrow, respectively.</p> <br>

         <h2>Stuck At Fault</h2>
         <p>The stuck at Fault is a fault in which the logical value at a given place will stuck at one logic. In stack at 1 fault the logical value will be 1 at that point independent of the inputs to the circuit.In stack at 0 fault the logical value will be 0 at that point independent of the inputs to the circuit. </p><br>
         <p>These stuck at fault can be anywhere in the circuit, it could be at the input lines, it could be at output lines or it could be the output of any gate in bertween the circuit. </p><br>
         <p>In our project we have full subtractor circuit. In full subtractor circuit we have three input lines and two otput lines. To impliment the full subtractor circuit we will need two xor gate , one or gate , two not gate and two and gate.</p><br>
         <p>The possible fault site in the full subtractor circuit are: at the three input lines, at the two output lines, and the three connection in between the circuit Diagram.</p>

    <h2>Detection Of Stuck At Fault (SA1)</h2>
      </div>
     
      <br>
      <p>We have written the code for the full subtracter. We will detect the fault in the circuit at different location based on the input value and output value we get from the simulator for different set of input value. </p>
      <p>We have assumed that at a time only one stuck at fault is present in the circuit.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>Stuck at Input A</h4>
      <p>To detect the stuck at 1 at A , we will the input as a=0 b=0 bin=0, if the output is diff=0 and bout=0 then there is no fault at any port. but if the output is diff=1 and bout=0. then the a has at stuck at 1 fault.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>Stuck at output Diff</h4>
      <p>If the value of diff is one for all 8 possible input cases then there is stuck at 1 fault at the diff.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>Stuck at output Bout</h4>
      <p>If the value of Bout is one for all 8 possible input cases then there is stuck at 1 fault at the Bout or one or both of the wire 2 and wire 3 are at stuck at 1 fault.</p>
      
      <br>
      <h4>Stuck at Input B</h4>
      <p>To find the stuck at 1 fault at input B we will observe the value wire "w1". The wire w1 is the output of the A xor B . for A=0, B= 0, if the value of w1 is 0 then there is no fault in input B. If the value becomes 1 then either there may be stuck at fault A or B. we will find out if there is stuck at 1 fault in 1. if there is no stuck at 1 fault at 1 then we can say B has stuck at 1</p>
      <br>
      <h4>Stuck at Input Bin</h4>
      <p>
      The Bin is directly connected to the and gate, if for all values of 0 input to bin if we get result of input 1 then we can say that the Bin is stuck at 1.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4>Stuck at 1 at wire 1</h4>
      <p>
        if irrespective of all the values of A and B the value at wire 1 is 1. then we can say that wire 1 which is xor of a and B is stuck at 1 fault.  
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4>Stuck at 1 at wire 2</h4>
      <p>
        if the bout is 1 always, then either wire 2 or wire 3 are at stuck at 1 fault because the one input in or gate is always 1. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4>Stuck at 1 at wire 3</h4>
      <p>
        if the bout is 1 always, then either wire 2 or wire 3 are at stuck at 1 fault because the one input in or gate is always 1. 
      </p>
